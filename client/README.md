# Quiz point 

## Todos 

Create a user context for the whole program, and change the navbar based on that

1. Allow user to register, login, create, save quizzes - basically test the API 
2. Allow users to make the quiz public, and allow them to take any other quiz they want, 
and allow randoms to take that quiz 
3. After these are done, make suitable error messages, UI improvements (like spinners, disabling input), etc.
4. Make the website responsive
