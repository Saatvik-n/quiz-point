# Quiz point 

## Todos 

Create a user context for the whole program, and change the navbar based on that

1. Allow user to register, login, create, save quizzes - basically test the API 
2. After these are done, make suitable error messages, UI improvements (like spinners, disabling input), etc.
3. Make the website responsive 

### Immediate todos 

* Change position of buttons in modal
* Take quiz, delete quiz works when selecting a quiz 

### Later 

* Take care of all TODOs
* Make page responsive 
* Don't allow user to go to protected routes

Document everything

### Optimizations  

You can deploy it after finishing till here

Implment all these later, after all the app's functionalities are finished

* Try to clean up use of duplicate functions, like `changeOptionText`
* See effects of `React.memo` on components 
* When user logs in, his list of quizzes should be cached, so that they load faster
