# Quiz point 

## Todos 

### Immediate 

Add an `error` object to the `CreateQuizContext`, and display it during the following cases:
* When a user tries to delete a radio option which is selected
* display the current question the user is on 
* display a plus sign if he is on the last question
### Later 

* Try to clean up use of duplicate functions, like `changeOptionText`
* See effects of `React.memo` on components
